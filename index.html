<h1>HomePod Tips</h1>

<p>I bought the HomePod as a speaker. I figured Siri was just a dumb gimmick that I would never use, but Siri on HomePod is so much better at hearing and understanding than I expected. (In fact, I kinda love it.) Here's a list of of all the things I've found Siri on HomePod can do.</p>

  <h3>Weather</h3>
  
    <blockquote>
  when will it stop raining?
    </blockquote>
  
    <blockquote>
  what's the temperature?
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
  what's the weather for today?
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
  what's the low tonight?
    </blockquote>


  <h3>Dates</h3>

  <blockquote>
    How many days until December 25th?
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    what day is next Monday?
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    when is the next leap year?
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    when does daylight savings time end?
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    when is Easter?
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    when does Ramadan end?
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    what astrological sign is January 1?
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    what phase is the moon?
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    when is the next full moon?
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    when did the sun rise?
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    when is sunrise tomorrow?
  </blockquote>
  
  
  
  <h3>Maps and Locations</h3>

  <p>Basic distances ("as the crow flies") of cities, streets, businesses or landmarks.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    how far away is the airport?
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    how far away is Montréal?
  </blockquote>

  <p>Personal fave: Opening and closing hours...</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    when does the library open?
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    how late is the "home depot" open?
  </blockquote>
            
  <blockquote>what's the nearest paint store?</blockquote>
  
  <p>And when you find a business, you can call them using your iPhone...</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    call them
  </blockquote>
  
  
  
  <h3>Reminders</h3>
  
  <p class="comment">I've never understood the <b>Reminders</b> app. If you add a reminder, it gets created, but is generally forgotten as the notification is easy to miss. (The irony!) So, I use <b>Reminders</b> as more of a todo list.
   </p>

  <blockquote>
    create a grocery list
  </blockquote>
   
  <blockquote>
    add raisins to my grocery list.
  </blockquote>
  
  <h3>Notes</h3>
  
  <blockquote>
    create a "shows to watch" note
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    add to my "shows to watch" note<br />
    {wait for prompt}<br />
    bojack horseman
  </blockquote>

  
   <h3>Timers</h3>
     
   <p>It's definitely helpful to name your timers, since the alarm sound is always the same.</p>
     
  <blockquote>
     start a five minute timer named "tea".
  </blockquote>
    
  <blockquote>
    what are my paused timers?
  </blockquote>
    
  <blockquote>
     what are my running timers?
  </blockquote>     
  
  
  <h3>Math</h3>
  
  <p>More than just a calculator.</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      what's a prime number under 100?
    </blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>
      random number between 1 and 100
    </blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>
      what is pi times 5 squared?
    </blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>
      what is six factorial?
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      what's 3/16 + 7/8?
    </blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>
      what is 400 degrees Fahrenheit?
    </blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>
      how many meters is six feet and one inch?
    </blockquote>
    
    
    
    <h3>Podcasts</h3>
    
    <p class="comment">The secret to playing podcasts is the trailing "podcast" keyword.</p>
      
    <blockquote>

    </blockquote>
        
    <p>It seems like you <i>should</i> be able to play a podcast by an episode number, but
      I could not get it work. If you've cracked this, let me know!</p>
    
    <p>The HomePod is excellent at skipping ads.</p>
      
    <blockquote>
      Skip 30 seconds.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      Play it <span class="variable">double speed</span>.
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Other options: "half speed", "normal speed", "one and a half times normal speed"</p>
    
  </div>

    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Querying events is much easier...</p>
    
    <blockquote>

    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
    what's on my calendar <span class="variable">today</span>?
